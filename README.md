# ðŸ”¥ Jellyfin ratings V2ðŸ”¥
**Corrections have been made only to the conversion, which I recommend to install through the JavaScript Injector Plugin**

**Differences between the second version and the first:**

1. Getting more ratings and additional certifications from Metacritic and Rottentomates sites

2. Due to additional data sources, the data takes a little longer to load than in the first version.

3. Due to technical limitations, the code that integrates into the jellyfin page has a number of limitations. Such as unstable downloading of additional ratings from AlloCinÃ©, Douban sites and obtaining certificates from Metacritic and Rottentomates sites. This is due to the use of free proxy servers.

4. Additional ratings (AniList, Kinopoisk, AlloCinÃ©, Douban) will be uploaded only if the title and release year are found on the websites. Otherwise, there will be no data.  This is done to avoid receiving erroneous data.
